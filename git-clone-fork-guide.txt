Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide to forking a repository on GitHub, cloning it to your local machine, making changes, committing those changes, and pushing them back to your GitHub repository using Visual Studio Code:

**Forking a Repository:**

1. **Visit the Repository**: Go to the GitHub repository you want to fork, and click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the repository page. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

**Cloning the Forked Repository:**

1. **Copy the Repository URL**: On your forked repository's page, click the green "Code" button, and copy the repository URL provided (HTTPS or SSH).

2. **Open a Terminal**: Open a terminal or use the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code.

3. **Navigate to the Desired Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/directory
   ```

4. **Clone the Repository**: Use the `git clone` command to clone the repository from your GitHub account to your local machine. Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL you copied earlier:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-forked-repo.git
   ```

**Making and Committing Changes:**

5. **Open the Repository in Visual Studio Code**: Launch Visual Studio Code and open the cloned repository by selecting "File" -> "Open Folder" and choosing the directory where you cloned the repository.

```bash
git status
``` checks if there are any logs to be committed

```bash
git diff <file-name>
``` shows difference between two or more sets of changes in a git repo

```bash
git add <file>
``` Stages the changes

```bash
git commit -m "commit message"
``` Commit the changes with a message

```bash
git status
``` makes sure that there is nothing to commit and the working tree is clean

```bash
git log
``` lists a detailed history of commits in a Git repository

```bash
git branch
``` check which branch you are on before pushing the commits to the remote Github repo

```bash 
git push origin main
``` 

6. **Make Changes**: Open the files you want to modify, make your changes, and save the files.

7. **Stage Changes**: In Visual Studio Code, use the Source Control panel (usually on the left sidebar) to stage your changes. Click the "+" icon next to each file you want to include in the commit.

8. **Commit Changes**: Enter a commit message describing your changes and click the checkmark icon to commit the changes.

**Pushing Changes to Your GitHub Repository:**

9. **Push Changes to GitHub**: Use the following command to push your changes to your GitHub repository. Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you're working on (e.g., "main" or "master"):

    ```bash
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```

    For example:

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

**Creating a Pull Request:**

10. **Open GitHub**: Go to your forked repository on the GitHub website.

11. **Click "New Pull Request"**: GitHub will recognize the recent push and suggest creating a pull request. Click the "New Pull Request" button.

12. **Review Changes**: Ensure that the changes you made are displayed in the pull request.

13. **Create Pull Request**: Add a title and description to your pull request, and then click the "Create Pull Request" button.

Your pull request is now created, and it can be reviewed and merged into the original repository by the repository's owner or maintainers.
